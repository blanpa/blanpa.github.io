I have just finished the last week of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp week 6 of DataTalksClub.

We learned how Stream Processing allows us to process large streams of data in real-time and gain valuable insights from it. We learned about the architecture of Kafka and the important concepts like Topics, Partitions, and Consumer Groups.

It was especially exciting to develop a stream processing application by integrating Kafka and Python using the "Faust" library. We created Kafka topics, produced and consumed data, and built and ran our own Stream Processing applications.

I am excited about how powerful and flexible Kafka and Stream Processing is and look forward to exploring these technologies further in the future, especially in combination with MQTT in an industrial environment. Thanks to the DataTalksClub team for this great learning opportunity!
