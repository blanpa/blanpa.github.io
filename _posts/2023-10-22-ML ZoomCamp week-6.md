üåø Excited to share my journey through the Machine Learning Zoomcamp by DataTalks.Club, particularly the module on Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning! This module covered key concepts and techniques related to tree-based models, which are fundamental in handling credit risk scoring projects. Some key takeaways include:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the core principles behind decision trees and how they can be leveraged to predict the risk of default.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploring Random Forest - a powerful ensemble technique that combines multiple decision trees for more accurate predictions.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Dive into Gradient Boosting as an alternative way of combining decision trees, further enhancing the model's predictive performance.

The practical, hands-on approach of this course has been invaluable, allowing me to apply these techniques to real-world problems and kickstart my journey into machine learning engineeringüõ†Ô∏è.

I highly recommend checking out the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/06-trees) for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms.
