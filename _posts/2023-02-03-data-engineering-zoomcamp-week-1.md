I signed up for the Zoomcamp of DataTalksClub to build up my knowledge in the field of data engineering.

The first week introduced various topics such as Docker, Terraform, GCP, and how to feed data into PostgreSQL.

Last week's insights include:
- Setting up Docker Environment, Terraform, and a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform.
- Data Ingestion into PostgreSQL using Python.
- Performing the task that requires running SQL queries.

Looking forward to learning more about Data Engineering in this Zoomcamp.
