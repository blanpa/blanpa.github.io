Week 4 of the DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp was all about analytics engineering.

Here are some of the highlights:
- We got some hands-on experience using the Google platform and Big Query.
- We explored Data Build Tool (DBT), an open-source tool for managing analytics engineering workflows. We learned how to set it up, create data models for data in Google Big Query, connect it with our GitHub repo, create global variables, jinja templates, macros, and functions, and write documentation and tests for data assets.
- We also delved into data visualization using Google Data Studio. We learned how to connect to data sources, build custom metrics and create visualizations that tell a story with data.

Next week, we will be learning about Apache Spark, an open-source big data processing engine.

Overall, Week 4 was an enriching experience that expanded our knowledge and skills in analytics engineering.
