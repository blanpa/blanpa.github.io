The DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp's third week has ended. The focus of the week was all about Google Big Query (BQ). It is a cloud-based data warehousing solution that is serverless, fully managed, and native to the cloud, with integrated geospatial analysis, ML, and BI capabilities.

A recap of the concepts covered this week:
- OLAP vs OLTP
- Partitioning and Clustering in BQ
- Big Query best practices for reducing costs and enhancing query performance
- An overview of BQ Internals
- Using BQ ML to create and execute a Linear Regression model using standard SQL queries
- Hyperparameter tuning of models in BQ ML

I'm looking forward to seeing what the fourth week will bring in terms of new learnings.
