ðŸ“£ Thrilled to share my experience from the fifth week of the ML Ops Zoomcamp! This week was all about monitoring with Evidently and Grafana! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š

The ML Ops Zoomcamp, organized by DataTalks Club, has been an incredible journey of exploring the world of Machine Learning Operations. The fifth week focused on monitoring, a crucial aspect of maintaining and optimizing ML systems. The resources available on the ML Ops Zoomcamp GitHub repository (link: [GitHub - ML Ops Zoomcamp - Week 5](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/tree/main/05-monitoring)) provided extensive insights and hands-on exercises. ðŸ’¡ðŸ“š

Throughout the week, we delved into various monitoring-related topics, including:

ðŸ”¹ Importance of monitoring ML models and pipelines.
ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Evidently, an open-source library for ML model monitoring.
ðŸ”¹ Key concepts in model monitoring, such as data drift and performance degradation.
ðŸ”¹ Utilizing Evidently to analyze data drift and feature importance.
ðŸ”¹ Configuring Grafana, a popular visualization tool for monitoring and analytics.
ðŸ”¹ Building dynamic dashboards in Grafana to track and visualize key metrics.
ðŸ”¹ Leveraging Prometheus and Grafana to monitor ML systems.

The hands-on exercises using Evidently and Grafana were enriching experiences. By following the detailed instructions provided in the GitHub repository, we gained practical experience in setting up monitoring pipelines and visualizing metrics effectively. The combination of Evidently and Grafana proved to be a powerful duo for monitoring ML systems. ðŸ’ªðŸ“ˆ
