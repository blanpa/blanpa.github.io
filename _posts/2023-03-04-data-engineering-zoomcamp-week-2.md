The Second week of DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp covered interesting concepts and solutions about workflow orchestration with Prefect.

The 2nd week covered the following topics:
- The concept of Data Lake
- Introduction to Prefect
- ETL with GCP & Prefect
- Parametrizing Flow & Deployments
- Schedules & Docker Storage with Infrastructure

I am already looking forward to the next week, which will cover Data Warehouse.
