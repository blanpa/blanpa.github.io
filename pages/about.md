# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

Global challenges can only be overcome through cooperation and sustainable solutions. In this sense, my goal is to enable cooperation, manage projects and develop ideas that contribute to a sustainable economy.

I have strong technical knowledge combined with business awareness and project management experience gained through my studies and internships.

With my understanding of various technologies, I am able to articulate ideas and concepts and translate them into actionable plans. I contribute to project planning by understanding the relationships between roles in the team as well as between departments and by asking systematic questions, assessing difficulties and risks very well.
